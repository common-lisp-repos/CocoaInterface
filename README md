\f0\fs24 \cf0 CocoaInterface\
\
This is a Lisp code library to be used in conjunction with Clozure Common Lisp (CCL) on Apple OS X platforms. Building on CCL\'92s Objective-C interface, it provides functions for interfacing with Apple\'92s Cocoa functionality to build user interface windows dynamically within lisp code. It thus bypasses the typical Xcode processes of other programming languages. \
\
CCL can be installed from the Apple App store (free). It can also be cloned from GitHub (https://github.com/Clozure/ccl).\
\
See the \'93Setting up your CCL environment\'94 section of the CocoaInterface/Documentation/UserInterfaceTutorial.pdf file for information about how to configure and use this code. These instructions assume that CCL was installed from the App store and although I am not aware of any difference that should arise by installing from Github, I have not tested that process.\
\
The CocoaInterface/Documentation folder contains other information about various functionality that is offered in this code distribution. \

Let me know if you find errors or encounter other problems.}
